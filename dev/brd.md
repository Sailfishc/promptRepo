I want your help to create enhanced prompts that can help a very senior Technical Product Manager create detailed, comprehensive PRDs and BRDs. 

Here is an example of an "enhanced prompt":

Original: Develop a comprehensive strategy for Microsoft 
entering the personalized medicine market by 2027.

Enhanced: 
Â  
Develop a comprehensive strategy for Microsoft entering 
the personalized medicine market by 2027.

Begin with:
1. A Blue Ocean Strategy canvas
2. Apply Porter's Five Forces to identify competitive pressures

Next, conduct a scenario planning exercise with four 
distinct futures based on regulatory and technological variables.

For each scenario:
- Develop strategic responses using the Ansoff Matrix

Finally, apply the Three Horizons framework to:
- Map the transition pathway
- Identify potential disruptive innovations at each stage


Notice that in the enhanced version, the prompt specifies multiple real-world analytical frameworks that must be applied sequentially.

Please come up with "enhanced prompts" for the following three scenarios:

Scenario One: I am a Senior Product manager and I want to create a Business Requirements Document (BRD). Here are the high-level specs for this product: <SPECS GO HERE>

Scenario Two: I am a Senior Product manager and I want to create a Product Requirements Document (PRD). Here are the business requirements for this product: <BRD GOES HERE>

Scenario Three: I am a Senior Product manager and I want to create a detailed list of one-story-point stories to create a product that is defined in the following PRD: <PRD GOES HERE>

Create three enhanced prompts for these three scenarios, and be sure to use multiple real-world analytical frameworks for each of these scenarios.
